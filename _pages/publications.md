I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Dr Heidi Christensen](https://heidi-christensen.github.io/website//) and Dr [Stuart Cunningham](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/health-sciences/people/human-communication-sciences/stuart-cunningham). I am part of the [Speech and Hearing Research Group (SPandH)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/spandh). 

My research interests focus on the application of audio and speech technology to the healthcare domain. Mainly, recognising paralinguistic information in the speech of people with dysarthria.
